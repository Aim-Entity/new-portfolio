REASON FOR PROJECT:

I needed to revamp my portfolio as my old one was not responsive and very outdated. I also wanted to add some javascript to my new portfolio.

SKILLS I DEVELOPED:

My goal was to make a project speedly using my old code base and other resources. I learnt how to manage diffrent types of files as downloads and uploads.

TEST YOUR SELF:

`pip install pipenv` # DONT DO THIS COMMAND IF YOU HAVE ALREADY INSTALLED PIPENV <br />
`pipenv shell` <br />
`pipenv install django==3.0.7, django-crispy-forms, pillow` <br />

`git clone ...` # COPY AND PASTE CLONE URL FROM GITHUB <br />
`cd ...` # CD INTO PROJECT FOLDER HOLDING THE FOLDERS YOU SEE IN GITHUB <br />

`python manage.py makemigrations` <br />
`python manage.py migrate` <br />
`python manage.py runserver 8080` <br />
